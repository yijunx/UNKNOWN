# now let's think about the trade strategy
# then design the experiment...
# regression on high , low
# clf on close - open
# if close > open, buy at low, sell at close/high/open price, and must sell at xx to stop loss?
# if open > close, buy at high, sell at close/low/open price, and must sell at xx to step loss?
# this module will create a lot of models and run them
# to generate a lot of data
# then the analysis kit comes to analyze them to find out the best model to fit different traits

# shall let the laptop cpu running at all times...

# experiment on the close_high

set_of_keywords = []
set_of_model_parameters = []


# whether the input should be scaled!!!!! i think it must be scaled!!! to tell the real trend...



# experiment on the high/low
